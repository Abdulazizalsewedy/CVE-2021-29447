#  Technical Details

XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerabilities

XML offers the possibility to define custom entities that can be reused throughout a document. This can, for example, be used to avoid duplication. The following code defines an entity myEntity for further usage.

The value of defined entities can also stem from an external source referenced by a URI. In this case, they are called external entities:

XXE attacks misuse this feature. They are possible when a loosely configured XML parser is run on user-controlled content. Loosely configured usually means that all entities are substituted with their corresponding value in the result. For example, in the last sample, if an attacker would supply file:///var/www/wp-config.php as the URI and is able to view the result of the parsed XML, she would successfully leak sensitive file content.

XXE in WordPress

WordPress has a Media Library that enables authenticated users to upload media files that can then be used in their blog posts. To extract meta information from these media files, e.g., artist name or title, WordPress uses the getID3 library. Some of this metadata is parsed in XML form. Here, it was reported a possible XXE vulnerability (line 730).
